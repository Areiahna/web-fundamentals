--- pokeapi.py ---

You are tasked with creating a Python application that interfaces with a public API, fetches data, and processes it. This application should provide insights into how different web architectures work and demonstrate your ability to set up a Python environment, make API requests, and handle JSON data.

    Task #1
    --------------------------------------------
    * Using "pokeapi.co/api" I used a get request to fetch data for the pokemon pikachu. Looped through his data to find specific keys "name" & "abilities". Instead of printing the entire dictionary for Snorlax's abilities I looped through that dictionary and displayed the name of each ability ONLY (otherwise screen would've looked very messy)

    Task #2
    --------------------------------------------
    * Created a function that takes an array of pokemon names. Loops through the data for each pokemon and pulls out their names, abilities & weight
  
    Task #3
    --------------------------------------------
    * Created a function that takes an array of pokemon names and returns the average weight of all 3
